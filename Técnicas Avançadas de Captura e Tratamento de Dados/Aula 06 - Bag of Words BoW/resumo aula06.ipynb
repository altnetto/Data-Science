Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\n    says:\n\n\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.
